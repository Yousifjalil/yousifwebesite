                <p class="lead" align = left> First I started by downloading Git Bash which is a version control software in the Shell environment I had a pretty simple experience with shell before, the only thing command I know was “ipconfig” which was used to get connectivity info in the CMD.<br></p>
                <img src ="assets/img/git_bash.png" >
                <p class ="lead" allign = "left">
               <br><br><br>
                    Anyways I knew previously about GitHub but I had no idea that people actually Git bash to upload files in their repositories. I used GitHub to before to download things but never considered that it can be used to document progress.</p>
                <p>I learned some of the basic bash commands such as
                  <br> <br> <b>ls : List all folders in current directory</b>
                  <br> <br> <b>cd: Change directory</b>
                  <br> <br> <b>cd ../ : Go 1 directory level up </b>
                  <br> <br> <b>cd ~ : Go to the main directory</b>
                    <br> <br> <b>mkdir: Make a directory	</b><br><br> </p>
                    
                     
<p class = "lead"> <b>GitHub Setup </b>
                    After creating a GitHub account, it is important to connect your machine/computer to your GitHub account, by using these two commands on the bash:
                </p>
                <p> First connecting the Username</p>
                <img src ="assets/img/git_username.JPG" > <br><br><br>
                <p>Connecting the Email</p>
                <img src ="assets/img/git_email.JPG" >
                
                <p class = "lead"> <br> After connecting to your GitHub account, it’s time to add a secure way to keep updating your files without putting your username and password each time, and that can be done by using ssh key. <br>
                    -	To get the ssh key: <br>
                    1.	go to your GitHub account and navigate to your created “yournamewebsite”<br>
                    2.	Click on the green code button<br>
                    3.	Copy the ssh code<br>
                    </p>
                <img src = "assets/img/ssh.JPG" width="1000" height="500">
                
                <p> <br> Then you have to open GitHub in the folder that you want your project to be in and use the command: git clone “ssh address of the project” <br> <br>
                                                </p>   
                <img src = "assets/img/git_clone.JPG">
        
                            <p> <br> <br>After that I learned about the commands that we are going to use constantly to add files to my GitHub</p>
                            <p>1.	“git Status”: to see the condition of our directory <br> </p>
                <img src = "assets/img/git_status.JPG">
                <br>
                <br>
                
                            <p>2.	“git add .” : to add files</p>
                <img src ="assets/img/git_add.JPG"> <br><br>
                            <p>3.	“git commit -m “message that shows on uploaded file”</p> <br>
                <img src="assets/img/git_commit.JPG"><br> <br>
                            <p>Notice that the messages that you write on the commit command are displayed in GitHub when uploaded, also so that you know or have a description of the files that are uploaded.</p>
                <img src="assets/img/git_commit_msg.JPG"> <br> <br>
                
                            <p>Finally, the last command which is pushing the files to your GitHub repository: “git push”</p>
                <img src="assets/img/git_push.JPG"> <br> <br>
                
                            <p class = "lead ">Then the Next step was making a website and documenting all the stuff in it. Me myself I am not a programming expert or have any experience in HTML, so I used readymade templates from StartBootstrap.com then all I had to do was to tweak the template a little bit to my pages and pictures etc. We were recommended Engineer Hashim to use the Brackets software which is a text editor that has a good feature which is live updates that allows you to preview your updates live.</p> <br>
                <img src="assets/img/brackets.png" width="400" height="400"> <br><br>
                
                            <p>The Template that I used is from <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">StartBootstrap.com</a>  is called <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/">Bare</a> I found it simple enough to edit as I wanted</p> <br>
                
                
                            <p>After I installed the Brackets software and downloaded the template, I copied all the files from the template to my website’s folder “yousifwebsite” </p> <br>
                            <p>1.	template folder</p> <br>
                <img src="assets/img/bare_files.JPG" > <br><br>
                
                            <p>2.	Website Folder</p> <br>
                
                <img src="assets/img/website_folder.JPG"> <br><br>
                            <p>Then I Started editing the website in Brackets by adding more pages and information</p> <br>
                            <img src="assets/img/Brackets.JPG">
